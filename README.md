# Graduate Projects

This is the beginning of the process of moving code from my graduate and undergraduate projects into repositories. It is very probable that pieces of code will be broken in the transition until I perform platform agnostic code surgery to remedy it.

If I have missed giving credit where credit is due, or keeping licenses affixed to codebases, please feel free to email me and I will fix this grievous error on my part ASAP.
